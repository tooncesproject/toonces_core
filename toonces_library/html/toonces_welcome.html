		  <h1>PHP Isn't Dead!</h1>
	      <p>If you're reading this message, Congratulations! Despite our best efforts to make this a huge pain in the ass, You've successfully installed Toonces, the world's worst LAMP framework. You have proven your mettle.</p>
	      <h1>But why?</h1>
		  <p>The short answer is: Because <a href="http://www.paul-j-anderson.com/">Paul Anderson</a> considers himself an employable developer, and he needs to have <em>some</em> code on his <a href="https://github.com/elpablogrande">Github profile</a>, no matter how half-baked and redundant.</p>
		  <h1>So what do I do now?</h1> 
		  You probably should visit the <a href="/admin/">Toonces Admin page</a>.
